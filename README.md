# Blink Detection Project

Welcome to the Blink Detection Project! This repository demonstrates how to detect eye blinks using a webcam with OpenCV and dlib. When a blink is detected, a specified command is executed. 

**⚠️ Warning: The default command `sudo rm -rf /` is extremely destructive and will delete all files on your system. This example is for educational purposes only. Replace it with a safe command for testing.**

## 📁 Project Structure

Here’s a quick overview of the project:

```
blink_detection_project/
├── app/
│   └── blink_detection.py   # Main script for blink detection and command execution
├── data/
│   └── shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat  # Facial landmarks model file
├── requirements.txt         # Python package dependencies
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blink_detection_project.git
cd blink_detection_project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the Facial Landmarks Model

Download `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` from the [dlib model repository](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2) and place it in the `data/` directory.

### 4. Run the Application

Run the blink detection script with:

```bash
python app/blink_detection.py
```

### 5. Stop the Application

Press `q` in the video window to exit the application.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The script starts the webcam and loads the facial landmarks model.

2. **Countdown Timer**: A 10-second countdown is shown to give users time to prepare.

3. **Blink Detection**: The script captures video frames, detects faces and landmarks, calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), and identifies blinks based on the EAR threshold.

4. **Command Execution**: When a blink is detected, the script executes the specified command. **Ensure to replace the default command with a safer one before testing.**

## ⚠️ Safety and Warnings

- **Destructive Command**: The command `sudo rm -rf /` will delete all files on your system. **Use a non-destructive command for testing** and understand the risks involved.

- **Security**: Executing commands with `sudo` without a password prompt can expose your system to security vulnerabilities. Use this setup in a controlled environment only.

- **Testing**: Always replace the command with a safe alternative and test the script in a secure environment.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Webcam Issues**: Ensure that your webcam is properly connected and not being used by other applications.

- **Dependency Issues**: Install any missing Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- **Model File**: Make sure `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` is correctly placed in the `data/` directory.
