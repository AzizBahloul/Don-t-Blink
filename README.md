# Blink Detection Project

Welcome to the Blink Detection Project! This project demonstrates how to use a webcam and OpenCV to detect eye blinks. When a blink is detected, a specified command is executed. 

**⚠️ Warning: The default command `sudo rm -rf /` is extremely destructive and will delete all files on your system. This example is provided for educational purposes only. Use a safe command for testing.**

## 📂 Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project directory:

```
blink_detection_project/
├── app/
│   └── blink_detection.py   # Main script for blink detection and command execution
├── data/
│   └── shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat  # Facial landmarks model file
├── requirements.txt         # Python package dependencies
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blink_detection_project.git
cd blink_detection_project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the Facial Landmarks Model

Download the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file from the [dlib model repository](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2) and place it in the `data/` directory.

### 4. Run the Application

Execute the blink detection script:

```bash
python app/blink_detection.py
```

### 5. Stop the Application

Press `q` in the video window to exit the application.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The script initializes the webcam and loads the facial landmarks model.

2. **Countdown Timer**: A 10-second countdown is displayed to give users time to prepare.

3. **Blink Detection**: The script captures video frames, detects faces and facial landmarks, calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), and identifies blinks based on EAR thresholds.

4. **Command Execution**: Upon detecting a blink, the script executes a specified command. **Replace the default command with a safer one for testing purposes.**

## ⚠️ Safety and Warnings

- **Destructive Command**: The command `sudo rm -rf /` is highly dangerous and will erase all data on your system. **Use a safe command for testing** and understand the risks involved.

- **Security**: Running commands with `sudo` without a password prompt can expose your system to security vulnerabilities. Only use this in a controlled environment.

- **Testing**: Always test with non-destructive commands before using any real command. Ensure the script behaves as expected.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Webcam Issues**: Ensure your webcam is connected properly and not being used by other applications.

- **Dependency Issues**: Install any missing Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- **Model File**: Verify that the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file is correctly placed in the `data/` directory.
